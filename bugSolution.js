```javascript
import Link from 'next/link';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Link href="/">
        <a>Home</a>
      </Link>
      <Link href="/about">
        <a>About</a>
      </Link>      
    </div>
  );
}

// Ensure that the / and /about pages are defined in your pages directory
export default MyComponent;

//In pages directory:
//pages/index.js
//pages/about.js
```
The solution involves verifying that the routes `/` and `/about` exist in the pages directory.  Additionally,  using only the `Link` component without the inner `<a>` tag often leads to more robust navigation and may enhance performance and SEO.  If a custom styling is needed, it's recommended to apply styles using CSS modules or styled-jsx.
