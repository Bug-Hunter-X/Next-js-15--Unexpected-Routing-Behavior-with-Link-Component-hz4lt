```javascript
import Link from 'next/link';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Link href="/">
        <a>Home</a>
      </Link>
      <Link href="/about">
        <a>About</a>
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```
This code uses Next.js's Link component, but it might lead to unexpected behavior in Next.js 15 if the `href` values are not correctly specified. Specifically, if the routes `/` and `/about` are not defined or handled properly, the user may encounter a 404 error or the navigation may not function as expected.  Another subtle issue could be related to the usage of the `a` tag within the `Link` component. While generally it works, using `Link` alone is more robust and may lead to better SEO and performance.
