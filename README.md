# Next.js 15: Unexpected Routing Behavior with Link Component

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with Next.js 15's Link component, where improper route configuration or usage can lead to unexpected routing behavior, potentially resulting in 404 errors or incorrect navigation.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file contains a Next.js component that uses the `Link` component to navigate to different routes.  However, if the routes specified in the `href` prop are not correctly handled by the Next.js application, the navigation may fail, resulting in a 404 error or the page not rendering properly.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution which involves:

1. Ensuring that the routes specified in the `href` prop of the `Link` component actually exist in the application's routing configuration.
2. Avoiding unnecessary nesting or improper usage of anchor tags within the `Link` component.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the behavior of the links on the page.

## How to Fix

1. Verify that your routes are correctly defined.
2. Ensure that you handle potential 404 scenarios gracefully in your application.
3. Always use the `Link` component from Next.js for internal navigation.
